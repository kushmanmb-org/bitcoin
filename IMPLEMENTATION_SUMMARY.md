## Secure Bitcoin Ownership Workflows
To ensure secure ownership of Bitcoin, it is crucial to follow a series of best practices:

3. **Regularly Backup Wallets:** Ensure all wallet backups are up-to-date and stored securely.
4. **Be Wary of Phishing Attacks:** Always verify the source of communications and links pertaining to your Bitcoin.
